# <i class="fa fa-microchip fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me

I'm a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://computing.louisiana.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>, School of Computing and Informatics at University of Louisiana at Lafayette. 
Before joining UL, I received my Ph.D. degree from the [iQua](http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu) research group in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto， in 2018. 

My research interests include big data analytics, machine learning systems, cloud computing, datacenter networking, resource allocation and scheduling in networked systems.
