Li is currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [iQua research group](http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/index.html) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto. She received her B.Engr. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, in July 2012, and her M.A.Sc. degree from the University of Toronto, in January 2015, under the supervision of Prof. [Baochun Li](http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/index.html).

During her graduate years in iQua, Li has studied interesting research problems related to resource allocation and performance optimization in the era of cloud computing and big data, with the constraints of fairness. She is interested in applying theoretical tools to study real problems and deriving insights to guide the design of a practical system. She won the award of **best paper candidate** for the paper published in IEEE IC2E 2016 and the award of **best-in-session presentation** for the presentation of her work in IEEE INFOCOM 2016.

During her undergraduate years, Li achieved excellent academic performance, especially in courses of mathematics and major fundamentals, ranking the top 3% among four hundred students. In the summer of 2011, she received an opportunity to take an internship at Baidu, Inc. in Beijing, the largest search engine provider in China. In her final year, she joined the research group of “Cloud Datacenter & Green Computing/Communications” in her university, actively involved in the thesis project of analyzing the tradeoff between power and performance in datacenter networks. She also took some volunteer work such as organizing scientific lectures.
